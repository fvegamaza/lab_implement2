# Customer Churn - Top 34% (40 teams)
> Internal competition

## My experience through this
This was my first contact with real dataset and real coding structure. Probably at the beginning of 2019. At that point on my learning path was extremely frustanting
to me trying to increase the preformance of my model, mainly for two reasons.
- Just a few months before the competition, and before this one I've never code anything before
- A lot of teoric in a short period of time
We were two in the team. And I remember the most shocking part was that I tried to predict N/A in the dataser to improve the score. But I didn't know
that xgoosbost handle it by itself, I noticed it two weeks after the competition had finished. That event really encourage me to study the background of the code.

## Technical aspects
It was a competition with a lot of support.

## About the dataset:
- I didn't use all the databases because it decreased the performance (Or I didn't find the correct way to make it useful)
- I did mix some features with brute force, creating a new dataset. After that I did feature selection adding some random variables between 1 and 0 and with the feature
importance I could realize which of them were good

*Still A lot to improve, but im working on it.*
